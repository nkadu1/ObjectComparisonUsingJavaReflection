PURPOSE:
Design a simple taskmanager code in Java

FILES:

Following are the files that are necessary for the project to run:-
First.java
Fileprocessor.java
Driver.java
Second.java
PopulateObjects.java

SAMPLE OUTPUT:

 [java] 0,printoutput method is called
 
     [java] Number of non-duplidate First objects :237
     
     [java] Total Number of First objects :474
     
     [java] Number of non-duplidate Second objects :263
     
     [java] Total Number of Second objects :526
     
     [java] Total time: 0.047000


Choice of Data-Structure
I used Hasmap as it is more efficient to traverse and to calculate required number of objects
Other reasons are
Stores value in key/value pair
Keeps Key using overridden methods unique
Not synchronised hence faster
